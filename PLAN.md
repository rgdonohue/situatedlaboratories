# Situated Laboratories – Dharma & Yoga Practice Site  
_Project Brief & Content Plan (v0.1)_

---

## 1. Purpose & Overview

**Situated Laboratories** is being rebooted as a home for:

- Dharma and yoga practice grounded in everyday life
- Recovery-oriented, nervous-system-aware approaches to practice
- Writing, audio, and video resources that weave:
  - Early Buddhist teachings (Four Noble Truths, Eightfold Path)
  - Ashtanga’s eight limbs (with emphasis on breath, bandhas, pratyahara, ethics)
  - Health, recovery, climate grief, and late-capitalist burnout

This is **not** a GIS/mapping portfolio (that role now lives with **Small Batch Maps**).  
This is a **practice lab** for people navigating suffering in a burning world.

---

## 2. Goals

1. **Offer real, workable practices**  
   Short, grounded practices (audio/video) people can actually use in messy lives.

2. **Integrate dharma, yoga, and recovery**  
   Show how the Four Noble Truths and the eight limbs apply to addiction, burnout, and systemic harm.

3. **Tell honest, public-facing stories**  
   Essays and diagrams that name power, injustice, and grief while staying rooted in practice.

4. **Create a soft doorway into deeper work**  
   Optionally point toward 1:1 accompaniment, small groups, or other offerings—without building a “sales funnel.”

---

## 3. Audience

Primary audiences:

- People in or exploring **recovery** (alcohol, substances, process addictions).
- **Burned-out helpers**: organizers, caregivers, therapists, teachers, tech / knowledge workers.
- Practitioners drawn to **dharma and yoga** who:
  - Don’t resonate with guru culture or culty vibes.
  - Want depth without dogma or spiritual bypass.
  - Care about justice, ecology, and collective liberation.

---

## 4. Positioning & Core Promise

Working tagline:

> **Dharma, Yoga & Recovery Practice**  
> *Rooted in Embodiment. Guided by Liberation.*

Expanded positioning:

> Situated Laboratories is a home for practice, writing, and experiment at the intersection of Buddhist insight, Ashtanga yoga, and long-haul healing. It offers practices, reflections, and maps for people navigating recovery, burnout, and life in a burning world—without gurus, spiritual bypass, or toxic positivity.

## 7. Tone, Ethics & Boundaries

### 7.1 Tone

- Direct, sober, and warm.
- No guru theatrics, no spiritual flexing.
- Willing to name:
  - Capitalism
  - White supremacy
  - Climate collapse
  - Digital fascism and disinformation
- Always ties back to practice: “So what do we do with this in our bodies, schedules, and choices?”

### 7.2 Boundary Statements

Include a clear disclaimer section (footer + FAQ):

- This site is **not therapy**, medical care, or crisis support.
- Practices are shared as personal and educational material.
- Encourage readers to:
  - Work with licensed clinicians, doctors, or crisis lines as needed.
  - Use discernment; adapt practices to their own context and support network.

---

## 8. FAQ Draft (v0.1)

**Is this therapy or treatment?**  
No. Situated Laboratories offers spiritual practice, reflection, and nervous-system-friendly tools. I’m not functioning here as a therapist or doctor, and nothing on this site is medical or clinical advice.

**Who is this for?**  
People in or curious about recovery; burned-out helpers and organizers; tech and knowledge workers; and anyone drawn to dharma and yoga who wants depth without dogma or guru culture.

**Do you work with people 1:1?**  
Sometimes. When I have capacity, I offer spiritual accompaniment / practice mentoring (not therapy). We focus on contemplative practice, ethics, and integrating dharma into everyday life.

**What if I’m in crisis or unsafe right now?**  
This site isn’t equipped for crisis response. If you’re in immediate danger or distress, please reach out to local emergency services, a crisis hotline (e.g., 988 in the U.S.), or trusted people on the ground.

## 10. Technical / Design Notes (High-Level)

- **Aesthetic:**
  - Echo 2010 Situated Labs: clean, typographically strong, minimal icons.
  - Palette: calm neutrals with a single accent color (e.g., deep teal or rust).
  - Plenty of whitespace; nothing “busy” or over-illustrated.

- **Implementation (v0.1 idea, flexible):**
  - Static site generator (e.g., Eleventy, Astro, or Hugo) or simple Next.js site.
  - Markdown-based content for essays and practice notes.
  - Embed audio/video via simple player (self-hosted or privacy-respecting platform).
  - RSS feed for Field Notes.

- **Future Possibilities:**
  - Tagging system for posts (e.g., “craving,” “grief,” “nervous system,” “Ashtanga,” “politics”).
  - Interactive diagrams or maps for certain essays.
  - Member area for small group courses (only if/when it feels right).

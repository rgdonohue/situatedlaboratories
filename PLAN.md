# Situated Laboratories – Dharma, Yoga & Justice Site  
_Project Brief & Content Plan (v0.2)_

---

## 1. Purpose & Overview

**Situated Laboratories** is being rebooted as a home for:

- Yoga and Buddhist practice grounded in everyday life
- Social and ecological justice woven into dharma (not bolted on)
- Thoughtful writing and simple practices for people living through political, climate, and digital upheaval

This is **not** a GIS or mapping portfolio (that role lives with **Small Batch Maps**).

Instead, it’s a **practice-centered laboratory**: a place to experiment with how the Buddha’s teachings, the eight limbs of yoga, and systems-thinking can respond to the conditions of late capitalism, rising authoritarianism, and collective anxiety.

Recovery is present as subtext and personal history, but not the explicit top-level brand.

**Laboratories metaphor (explicit):**

> “Situated Laboratories” treats each life as a site-specific experiment in liberation. Practices are tested in real conditions — insomnia, grief, burnout, solidarity work — and refined with honesty rather than perfectionism.

---

## 2. Goals

1. **Offer grounded, workable practices**  
   Short, realistic practices that people can integrate into daily life, not aspirational retreats.

2. **Integrate dharma, yoga, and justice**  
   Show how the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, and the eight limbs of yoga speak directly to:
   - structural harm
   - climate crisis
   - digital overload
   - collective struggle

3. **Tell honest, public-facing stories**  
   Essays and diagrams that name power and systems (capitalism, white supremacy, digital fascism) while continually returning to:  
   *What does this mean for practice in a nervous system and a body?*

4. **Keep scope humane and sustainable**  
   Start text-first, with minimal tech and production overhead, and grow only as capacity and energy allow.

5. **Create a soft doorway into deeper work**  
   Offer optional ways to engage more deeply (readings, small groups, 1:1 sessions, donations) without building a marketing funnel.

---

## 3. Primary Focus & Audience

### 3.1 Primary Orientation

**Center of gravity:**  
- **Yoga/Buddhism + social justice.**  
- Recovery and mental health are present, but quiet — embedded in how suffering is understood, not branded explicitly.

### 3.2 Primary Audiences (v0.2)

1. **Justice-oriented dharma/yoga practitioners**
   - Folks who care about liberation *and* power structures.
   - Interested in integrating ethics, activism, and contemplative practice.

2. **Burned-out helpers and knowledge workers**
   - Organizers, educators, health workers, tech/logistics people.
   - Want practices that acknowledge systemic causes of burnout, not just “self-care.”

3. **Curious readers at the edges of practice**
   - People who’ve brushed up against dharma or yoga and want depth without:
     - guru culture
     - pseudoscience
     - spiritual bypass

Recovery-oriented readers are welcome and implicitly held by the framing, without being singled out as a niche.

---

## 4. Positioning & Core Promise

Primary tagline (hero):

> **Yoga, dharma & social justice practice for a burning world.**

Secondary phrase (can appear in footer, about page, or supporting text):

> *Experiments in liberation*

Expanded positioning:

> Situated Laboratories is a home for practice, study, and experiment at the intersection of Buddhist insight, Ashtanga yoga, and collective liberation. It offers essays, study guides, and simple practices for people navigating burnout, climate grief, political anxiety, and everyday suffering — without gurus, spiritual bypass, or toxic positivity.

---

## 5. Content Pillars (v0.2)

To reduce scope creep, v0.2 focuses on **two primary pillars** at launch and treats the third as “lightweight”:

### 5.1 Field Notes (PRIMARY)

**What it is:**  
Essays and short reflections on suffering, systems, and the path.

**Themes:**

- *Dharma in the Ruins* – Four Noble Truths in the context of climate, capitalism, and political breakdown.
- *Embodied Justice* – How ethics (yamas/niyamas, right speech, right livelihood) intersect with solidarity, organizing, and everyday choices.
- *Maps of Mind & World* – Geographical and cartographic metaphors for mind, craving, and collective conditions.
- *When It’s Actually Hard* – Short, real-time pieces on insomnia, anxiety, conflict, and grief from a dharma lens.

**Format:**

- Text-first.
- Occasional diagrams or simple images for clarity (Tufte-style when possible).
- Aim: 1 essay or note every **2–4 weeks** (cadence can adjust).

---

### 5.2 Practice Lab (SECONDARY at launch)

**What it is:**  
Simple, low-production practices that support readers of the essays.

**Launch strategy:**  
- **Start with audio-only**, minimal editing.
- Host text transcripts alongside audio.
- Green-light only what you can realistically sustain.

**Types of content (initial):**

- 5–10 minute practices:
  - “Grounding before reading the news”
  - “Micro-metta for when you’re pissed off”
  - “Three-breath reset between meetings”
- Occasional 15–20 minute sessions:
  - Body scan with right effort / right intention framing.
  - Breath-focused practice with light bandha and spine cues.

Video, complex sequences, and full Ashtanga progressions get deferred to a later phase.

---

### 5.3 Study & Support (LIGHTWEIGHT at launch)

**What it is:**  
A simple study hub with a few foundational texts and a soft pointer to future offerings.

**Initial content:**

- Short explainers:
  - Four Noble Truths
  - Eightfold Path
  - Eight limbs of yoga (with brief notes on bandhas, pranayama, pratyahara)
- A reading list:
  - “Three starting points for dharma + justice”
  - “Three starting points for yoga as path, not performance”

**Future (not required at launch):**

- Small-group series (“Dharma & Justice Lab,” “Eightfold Path in Everyday Work”).
- 1:1 accompaniment / mentoring page with clear boundaries.

## 7. Tone, Ethics & Boundaries

### 7.1 Tone

- Clear, intelligent, and non-performative.
- Willing to name:
  - Capitalism
  - White supremacy
  - Climate breakdown
  - Digital fascism and disinfo
- Always returns to:
  - What does this mean for practice?
  - What can one nervous system reasonably hold and respond to?

### 7.2 Boundaries & Disclaimers

Emphasize:

- This site offers **educational and spiritual** material, not professional clinical care.
- Material may touch on trauma, grief, and substance use, but:
  - It is not therapy.
  - It is not medical advice.
- Encourage readers to seek:
  - Licensed therapists / medical providers where needed.
  - Crisis hotlines (e.g. 988 in the U.S.) or local resources in emergencies.

FAQ snippet (for reuse):

> **Is this therapy or treatment?**  
> No. Situated Laboratories offers spiritual practice, study, and reflection. It’s not a substitute for therapy, medical care, or crisis support.

---

## 8. Accessibility & Justice Commitments

To align with a justice-oriented ethos:

- **Transcripts** for all audio (at least basic, edited over time).
- **High-contrast design** and legible type.
- Avoid autoplay media, flickering animations, or interaction that can spike nervous systems.
- Minimize paywalls; where paid content exists:
  - Offer sliding scale / scholarship / “no one turned away” policy where possible.

---

## 9. Discoverability & Outreach Strategy (v0.2)

Keep it *light* and honest, not growth-hacky.

**SEO basics:**

- Plain-language page titles and meta descriptions:
  - Include key phrases like “dharma and social justice,” “yoga and liberation,” “Buddhism and climate grief.”
- Semantic HTML structure and clear headings.

**Low-lift outreach:**

- Occasional posts or short threads on existing platforms (Twitter/X, Bluesky, Mastodon, etc.) summarizing:
  - New essays.
  - Key insights or diagrams.
- Guest essays or cross-posts:
  - On aligned dharma/justice blogs, newsletters, or orgs (long-term).

**Email list:**

- Choose a simple, privacy-respecting provider (e.g., Buttondown, Ghost, or similar).
- Cadence: “occasional dispatches,” not weekly grind.
- Use it to:
  - Announce new Field Notes and practices.
  - Share small announcements about experiments, groups, or retreats.

---

## 10. Sustainability & Revenue (Soft-Touch)

Even if not the main driver, name that this is labor.

**Options:**

- **Dana/Donations page:**
  - Explain traditional dana (generosity) and modern realities.
  - Include one-time and recurring options (Patreon, OpenCollective, etc.).

- **Sliding-scale 1:1 sessions (future):**
  - Framed as spiritual accompaniment / practice mentoring.
  - Clear scope: not therapy, not crisis work.

- **Small group offerings (future):**
  - Time-bound series (e.g., 4–6 weeks).
  - Themes like:
    - “Four Noble Truths in a Burning World”
    - “Ethics, Speech, and Online Life”

Monetization follows the content; content doesn’t become fodder for monetization.

---

## 11. Technical Decisions (v0.2 Draft)

To reduce complexity:

- **Framework / SSG:**  
  - Use a Markdown-first static site approach. For example:
    - Astro, Eleventy, or Hugo (final choice to be made once).
  - Requirements:
    - Easy Markdown content.
    - Simple RSS feed for Field Notes.

- **Hosting:**
  - Static hosting (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or similar).
  - Custom domain: `situatedlaboratories.com` (or existing domain).

- **Audio Hosting:**
  - Phase 1: host small audio files directly via site host or simple storage bucket.
  - Consider upgrading to a dedicated podcast/audio host only if needed later.

- **Email:**
  - Use a low-friction newsletter tool (e.g., Buttondown, Ghost, or similar).
  - Link clearly from Home and Support pages.

- **Analytics:**
  - Privacy-respecting option (e.g., Plausible, Fathom, or no analytics initially).
  - Focus on basic patterns (page views, referrers), not profiling.

## 12. Initial Content Backlog (Updated)

Prioritize pieces that are **text-first** and **aligned with dharma + justice**.

1. **Field Notes Essay:**  
   *“Dharma in a Burning World: Why Practice Still Matters”*  
   - Origin story + why Situated Laboratories exists now.

2. **Field Notes Essay:**  
   *“Uncertainty Without Numbing: Insomnia as Practice”*  
   - Expand on your recent reflection:
     - “I’ve always embraced uncertainty… it was easier when I could numb it.”
   - Frame insomnia and restlessness as part of the lab.

3. **Field Notes Essay:**  
   *“Four Noble Truths for Late Capitalism”*  
   - Dukkha → precarity, burnout, climate anxiety.  
   - “Origin” as structural causes, not just personal craving.  
   - Possibility of relief + path in that context.

4. **Study Note:**  
   *“Eightfold Path for People with Jobs and Phones”*  
   - Brief, practical framing of each factor.

5. **Practice (Audio + Transcript):**  
   *“Three-Breath Reset Before Reading the News”*  
   - 3–5 minutes, audio-only, simple.

6. **Practice (Audio + Transcript):**  
   *“Short Metta for Burned-Out Helpers”*  
   - 5–7 minutes of loving-kindness with justice-aware language.

7. **Diagram / Visual:**  
   *“From System to Sensation”*  
   - Visual showing:
     - Systemic conditions → events → thoughts → body sensations → actions.
     - Mark where practice can intervene (breath, ethics, attention).

## 13. Next Steps (Actionable v0.2)

1. **Lock core focus**
   - Confirm that yoga/Buddhism + social justice is the explicit center.
   - Affirm that recovery remains implicit, not foregrounded.

2. **Draft key pages**
   - `index.md` (Home): hero, 3 tiles, short bio, FAQ preview.
   - `about.md`: 500–700 words situating you and the lab metaphor.
   - First Field Notes essay (likely #1 or #2 above).
   - Simple Study page with at least one explainer (e.g., Four Noble Truths).

3. **Choose tech stack**
   - Decide on Astro/Eleventy/Hugo (or similar) and create repo + basic layout.
   - Add RSS feed for Field Notes.

4. **Set a humane content cadence**
   - Example:  
     - 1 Field Notes essay every 3–4 weeks.  
     - 1 new simple practice every 1–2 months.

5. **Add Access & Support scaffolding**
   - Draft Accessibility & Justice statement.
   - Add Support page:
     - Email list link.
     - Optional donation link (even if “coming soon”).

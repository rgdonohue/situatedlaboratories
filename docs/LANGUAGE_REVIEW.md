# Language Review: LLM-Smelling Phrases & Bullshit

## 🚩 Flagged Issues

### README.md

**Line 6:** "A practice-centered laboratory for integrating Buddhist insight..."
- "integrating" - corporate/LLM verb
- Could be: "A place for Buddhist insight, Ashtanga yoga, and collective liberation."

**Line 14:** "at the intersection of" 
- Classic LLM/marketing speak
- Could be: "Buddhist insight, Ashtanga yoga, and collective liberation."

**Line 20:** "Each life is a site-specific experiment in liberation"
- "site-specific" - academic jargon that might be trying too hard
- Could be: "Each life is an experiment in liberation" or keep if it's meaningful to you

**Line 20:** "refined with honesty rather than perfectionism"
- Sounds polished/LLM-generated
- Could be: "refined honestly" or "tested honestly"

**Line 28:** "that people can integrate into daily life"
- "integrate" - corporate verb
- Could be: "that fit into daily life" or "for daily life"

**Line 40:** "continually returning to"
- "continually" - unnecessary qualifier
- Could be: "returning to" or "always coming back to"

**Line 66:** "Readers are encouraged to seek"
- Corporate/LLM phrasing
- Could be: "Seek" or "Please seek"

**Line 68:** "If you find this work helpful and are resourced"
- "resourced" - buzzword
- Could be: "If you find this helpful and can afford it" or "If you're able"

**Line 106:** "If you find this work helpful and are resourced"
- Same issue, repeated

**Line 108:** "For questions, suggestions, or to report issues"
- Generic/LLM phrasing
- Could be: "Questions? Suggestions?" or just remove if contact info is elsewhere

### src/pages/index.astro

**Line 32:** "at the intersection of" 
- Same issue as README

**Line 35:** "We practice with the conditions we've got"
- This is actually good - direct and real

**Line 142:** "justice-oriented orientation"
- Redundant ("oriented orientation")
- Could be: "justice-oriented" or "oriented toward justice"

**Line 142:** "geographer, ex-professor, and dharma and yoga practitioner"
- "practitioner" - could be more direct
- Could be: "geographer, ex-professor, dharma student, and yoga practitioner"

### Newsletter Component

**Line 7:** "Stay in the experiment"
- This is actually good - unique and not generic

**Line 9:** "Infrequent notes when there's something worth saying"
- Good - honest and direct

## ✅ What's Actually Good

- "Experiments in liberation for a burning world" - direct, not corporate
- "without gurus, spiritual bypass, or toxic positivity" - specific and clear
- "Stay in the experiment" - unique voice
- "We practice with the conditions we've got" - real and direct
- "nervous systems under pressure" - specific, not generic
- "burning world" - direct metaphor

## Recommendations

### High Priority Fixes

1. Remove "at the intersection of" (appears twice)
2. Fix "justice-oriented orientation" redundancy
3. Replace "integrate/integrating" with simpler verbs
4. Remove "continually" qualifier
5. Replace "resourced" with "able" or "can afford"
6. Simplify "Readers are encouraged" phrasing

### Medium Priority

1. Consider if "site-specific" is necessary or just academic jargon
2. "refined with honesty rather than perfectionism" - could be more direct
3. "practitioner" - could be more specific

### Keep As Is

- "Stay in the experiment"
- "burning world"
- "nervous systems under pressure"
- Direct disclaimers and boundaries

## Summary

The main issues are:
1. **"at the intersection of"** - appears twice, very LLM/corporate
2. **"integrating/integrate"** - corporate verb
3. **"resourced"** - buzzword
4. **"justice-oriented orientation"** - redundant
5. **"continually"** - unnecessary qualifier
6. **"Readers are encouraged"** - corporate phrasing

The voice is mostly good - direct and honest. These are mostly small fixes that will make it sound more human and less polished.

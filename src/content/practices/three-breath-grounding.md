  # Three-Breath Grounding
  
  This is a simple practice you can do anywhere, anytime. No special posture needed. You can do this sitting, standing, or lying down.
  
  **First breath:** Take a slow, full breath in. Notice the air entering your body. As you breathe out, let your shoulders drop. Release any tension you're holding.
  
  **Second breath:** Breathe in again, this time noticing where in your body you feel the breath. Maybe it's your chest, your belly, your ribs expanding. As you breathe out, let your jaw relax. Unclench your teeth if they're clenched.
  
  **Third breath:** One more breath. This time, as you breathe in, bring your attention to your feet. Feel your feet on the floor, or your body on whatever surface you're on. As you breathe out, let yourself settle. You're here. You're present. This moment is enough.
  
  That's it. Three breaths. You can return to this anytime you need to ground yourself.

**When to use this:**
- Before reading difficult news or engaging with heavy content
- When you feel overwhelmed or anxious
- After a difficult conversation or interaction
- When transitioning between tasks
- Any time you need to reset your nervous system

**How long:** 3-5 minutes (or just three breaths if that's all you have)

## Notes

This practice doesn't ask you to change how you feel. It doesn't ask you to be calm or peaceful. It just asks you to notice your breath and your body for three breaths. That's enough.

If your mind wanders, that's fine. Just come back to the next breath. If you feel anxious or overwhelmed, that's okay. The practice isn't to make those feelings go away—it's to give your nervous system a moment to reset.

You can do this practice multiple times a day. You can do it in the middle of a difficult conversation (just take three breaths). You can do it before you open your email, before you check the news, before you start work. It's a tool, not a requirement.

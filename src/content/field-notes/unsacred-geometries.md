Here’s the scene as I remember it, or as it’s compiled from a dozen similar moments over my years in yoga and hippie festivals:

On the screen: the Flower of Life, laid over a galaxy, laid over a human silhouette. The teacher is talking about how this pattern shows up *everywhere* — shells, pyramids, DNA, the whole usual tour.

The subtext is clear:

Look. It’s all connected.
Therefore: a plan.
Therefore: a Planner.
People nod. Someone whispers “whoa.” Phones come out; the slide is clearly built for Insta posting. The patterns are captivating and sexy.

Inside my head, my inner skeptic is gasping for air.

One part of me is wide open to these ways of thinking. The pattern is beautiful. And even if the logical leaps strike me as spurious, good science itself is a partial work in progress. I must be open to alternative explanations and ways of knowing. 

And I’ve spent years tracing spatial patterns in health data, rivers, cities, forests; I know that little electric jolt when shapes echo across scales. The pattern-recognition part of my brain is happy to be stroked.

But other part of me is lightly irritated. Not with the geometry, but with the leap itself and the faith the audience is willing to throw at it all. From “this shape appears a lot” → “there must be a hidden intelligence behind reality” → “therefore your suffering is part of a perfect design.”

From simply observing form to embracing belief. That move feels somewhere between willful ignorance and desperate hope, less like reverence and more like a refusal to sit with not-knowing and simply apprciate that the Cosmos sometimes serves up some beautiful coincidences.

I don’t need to say anything. Sometimes practicing Right Speech means not saying anything at all. I don't need to steal this magic from anyone there. I breathe, I nod, I do the asana poses. But I leave thinking, perhaps there's a more subtle beauty that we pass over when captivated by perfect flowers floating in space. It’s going to be with the broken, messy geometries we encounter every day ... those defined not by the human science of mathametics but by the natural law of entropy itself?

Most of my geometries aren’t cosmic. They’re bureaucratic.

Shapefiles. GeoJSON layers. Parcel layers. Zoning districts. Watersheds. Irregular polygons some consultant drew in ArcGIS years ago and no one has touched since.

One afternoon, I’m deep in parcel data for an underpaid, mismanaged gig-work project. Zoomed way out, it looks almost virtuous: a grid, some diagonals, tidy blocks. The kind of order that makes planners feel like they’ve done their job.

Zoom in, and the facade falls apart.

Parcels shaved into weird wedges where a highway cut through a neighborhood.
Long, skinny remnants along an off-ramp — technically parcels, practically useless.
Little triangles crammed behind commercial strips, like they backed away from something and never came back out.

One specific lot still sits in my mind: a sharp triangle jammed between an arterial road, a ramp, and the back edge of a block. On the map it looks like a corner someone tried to erase and couldn’t quite finish. Its area is laughable. There’s a sliver of building footprint, some asphalt, maybe a dumpster. It’s the geometry of a place that lost every negotiation.

None of this looks like a mandala. And it’s not random. It’s the frozen record of very human decisions: where to run the highway, where to widen the road, which blocks to sacrifice, which neighborhoods to carve up because the people there had the least power to resist. Some of these irregularities are the result of the limitations of our technology itself, 8-bit encoding or rounding errors.

You don’t need a sacred overlay to see intention here. You need a basic sense of socio-technical history.

Put a redlining map next to the parcel layer and the patterns stack: places that were once outlined in red become the places where the blocks are strangled by ramps, sliced by arterials, starved of trees. You can watch wealth and whiteness harden into shape. You can watch certain geometries become long-term health risks and "high-risk" neighborhoods beholden to drugs and crime.

This is what I mean when I say “an archive of power rendered as geometry.” Not as a clever phrase, but as a pretty literal description. The map is a file cabinet. The polygons are what’s left after the hearings, the evictions, the fires, the “urban renewal,” the quiet decisions to invest on this side of the line and not that one.

Zoom out, and it almost passes for neutral. A pretty map, even. Zoom in, and the violence shows through. No one in a yoga studio is calling this sacred. But it shapes daily life far more than any hexagon on an Instagram slide.

Different day, different dataset. A digital elevation model — the land as a grid of numbers.

In theory, it’s clean: the earth, sampled. Cool detachment. Quiet authority.

Except that when you look closely, it’s full of gaps and scars.

A rectangular section where there’s just no data.
A vertical streak where the sensor glitched.
A join between two tiles that doesn’t quite match, so a ridge suddenly jumps or a valley flattens.

From a technical standpoint, they’re “artifacts” — the kind of thing you’re supposed to mask, interpolate, or otherwise make disappear.

From where I’m sitting, they’re more like honesty marks.

They say: this was stitched together. Someone flew a sensor over this place at a particular time, with a particular budget, under particular constraints, then ran it through a particular pipeline. Parts were missed. Parts were fudged. The “view from nowhere” is assembled from very specific somewheres.

Nobody looks at that missing rectangle and says, “Proof of a higher intelligence.” If anything, it’s proof that nobody has the whole thing. Not the state, not the engineers, not the GIS people, not the mystics, not the aliens.

The model is authoritative enough to convince a planner, but fragile enough to crack open if you poke it.

I trust that more than a seamless fantasy.

So when I hear sacred geometry used as a kind of all-purpose explanation — look, patterns → therefore purpose → therefore trust "the plan" — I feel a call to suspend reason and intelligence. Again, there are clear limits to our reason and intelligence ... apparently God can be experienced directly through a raw experience that transcends discursive thought.

I get the hunger underneath it. Life under late modern capitalism can be disjointed and alienating ... a hell built and maintained through our own labor, swipes, Amazon purchases, and suffering. Of course we want to find a pattern that says we’re held by something bigger than traffic, emails, lab results, rent, wars, elections.

But the leap from pattern to guarantee is dangerous, because it makes it too easy to aestheticize real harm.

If the geometry is sacred, then the eviction, the asthma cluster downwind of the refinery, the flood-prone neighborhood under the highway — all of it can be narrated as “part of the pattern.”

In the US inner cities and ghettos, that’s not an abstraction. You’ve got Tulsa 1921 burned into the soil, Greenwood razed, Black wealth literally erased. Then you get expressways dropped on top of Black neighborhoods in the name of progress. You can read that history in parcel outlines and right-of-way polygons.

Those shapes are not neutral. They’re not innocent. And they sure as hell aren’t evidence of a benevolent design.

This is where sacred-geometry talk starts to feel like spiritual bypass. It’s not that the patterns are fake. It’s that they’re used to dodge accountability. And here I don't mean to be overly forceful ... there is nuance and value in the sacred geometry teachings that I'm glossing over.

But if every spiral and hexagon is proof that “it’s all meant,” then is nothing allowed to just be what it is: the result of human design and choice, made by people, backed by priviledge, oppression, and force? What responsibilty to do have within these patterns of energy wavlets, redistributing themseles as we dance, pray, cry, and love within them?

The phrase I’ve been using for what I care about instead is **unsacred geometries**.

Not blasphemous. Not anti-spiritual. Just not hired to do metaphysical PR.

Desire paths across manicured lawns where walkers decided the official curve was wrong.
Bus routes that almost but not quite reach certain neighborhoods.
Floodplain boundaries adjusted to make a development pencil out.
Parcel lines that line up perfectly with old redlining boundaries, decades after those maps were “retired.”

These geometries don’t comfort me. They don’t tell me everything is secretly okay. They tell me that systems are contingent, contested, actively shaped — and therefore capable of being reshaped.

They invite different questions than sacred geometry does:

Not “What higher intelligence encoded this?”
But “Who drew this?”
“Who got consulted?”
“Who got displaced?”
“What happens if this line moves?”

And sometimes: “What happens in the gap between what the line claims and how life actually spills over it?”

If sacred geometry tends to smooth over the rough edges of suffering, unsacred geometry is the decision to leave those edges visible.

There’s also the quieter, more personal layer of why this nags at me.

I spent a chunk of my life inside academia being trained to analyze patterns “objectively.” Now I’m outside, working on contracts, building tools, writing code, trying to pay rent, trying to stay in conversation with dharma.

Most days I feel less like I’m following a mandala and more like I’m living in a glitchy map.

Projects don’t line up cleanly with values. Money comes from places that make me uneasy. My own life “geometry” — relationships, jobs, care work, creative stuff — has all the elegance of those messed-up Tulsa lots.

Zoomed out: sure, there’s a story arc. Burnout here, pivot there, a loose spiral around water, health, justice, maps, practice. Zoom in: it’s missed opportunities, half-finished repos, sudden moves, awkward conversations, things I’d redraw if I could.

And yet, when I sit — on a cushion, with a map, with a line of code that won’t behave — the living part of the dharma feels closest in the places that don’t resolve.

Not in the metaphors about oneness, but in the *very specific stuck places*:
the parcel you can’t make fair;
the dataset you can’t fully clean;
the habit you can’t immediately drop.

The temptation is always to escape up and out into some higher-level pattern that explains why it’s all unfolding “as it should.”

The practice, as I understand it right now, is to stay with the geometry as it is: skewed, partial, sometimes cruel, sometimes unexpectedly generous, never fully under my control.

I said I don’t have a grand conclusion, and I’m trying to keep that promise.

What I have, when I think about “unsacred geometries,” are a few images that keep tugging at me:

That triangular Tulsa lot jammed against the ramp, a monument to decisions made in rooms I’ll never see.

A DEM tile edge where the landscape jumps a meter, a seam shouting that the data was patched together and sold as smooth.

A desire path carving the shortest line between bus stop and apartment complex, refusing the planner’s curve.

A hand-drawn map in my notebook where the river is too wide, the roads don’t meet, and yet it feels closer to how the place actually lives in my body than any basemap.

None of these prove that the universe is kind or cruel, ordered or random.

They just insist that geometry is not neutral. That every line is a story. That some stories hurt more than others. That we don’t need flowers and ratios to justify any of it.

Maybe “unsacred geometry” is just a reminder to look at the shapes that already govern our lives before we go hunting for patterns in the stars.

For now, that feels like enough.

If you want a next step, bro, I’d say: grab one or two actual screenshots (Tulsa wedge, DEM seam), and on the site literally interleave them with the prose — let the map artifacts interrupt the text the way they interrupt the fantasy of order.

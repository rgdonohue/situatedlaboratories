          <h2>Practicing with the Conditions We've Got</h2>
          
          <p>
            With a PhD in Geography with an emphasis on Cartography, GIS, and Geospatial Data Science, I spent years transforming complex geospatial data into meaningful insights and maps. My academic work focused on ethical data practices, human-centered design, and treating every project as a unique challenge deserving custom solutions rather than cookie-cutter approaches.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But maps of the world are also maps of conditions—environmental, social, political. And the more I worked with data about climate change, environmental justice, and systemic inequity, the more I needed practices that could help me stay present to what the data was showing without burning out or turning away.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            That's where Buddhist practice and Ashtanga yoga came in. As a YTT-500 trained and certified yoga teacher, I bring both the technical precision of Ashtanga practice and the contemplative depth of dharma study to this work. Not as an escape from the difficulty of the world, but as a way to stay with it. To build the capacity to see clearly, to respond wisely, and to keep showing up even when the work is hard.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Situated Laboratories</strong> grows out of this intersection. Every mind is a situated laboratory—shaped by our bodies, our histories, our social positions, the places we live. We don't practice in a vacuum or in some idealized state. We practice with the nervous systems we have, in the conditions we're in, working with what's actually present.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This isn't about achieving enlightenment or perfecting poses. It's about building practices that help us stay grounded, see clearly, and act with care in a burning world. It's about integrating dharma teachings with social justice awareness, bringing contemplative practice into relationship with collective liberation.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Born and raised in Durango, Colorado, I continue to find teaching and grounding in these mountains—hiking, skiing, and walking meditation on the trails where the grass turns orange in fall and the leaves remind us what it means to let go.
          </p>
          
          <h3>What Makes This Different</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No gurus or spiritual hierarchy.</strong> This is peer-to-peer practice, not guru-disciple transmission.</li>
            <li><strong>No spiritual bypassing.</strong> Practice doesn't transcend systemic harm—it helps us respond to it.</li>
            <li><strong>Justice-oriented.</strong> Contemplative practice and collective liberation are deeply connected.</li>
            <li><strong>Experimental.</strong> Every practice is an experiment. We're testing what works in our actual conditions.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>How to Engage</h3>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Field Notes</strong> are reflections and essays connecting practice to lived experience, climate grief, and dharma teachings.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Practice Lab</strong> offers guided practices (some with audio, some text-only) for grounding, somatic awareness, and nervous system regulation.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>Study</strong> provides plain-language introductions to Buddhist concepts, framed for contemporary conditions.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This is a practice for uncertain times. Welcome to the laboratory.
